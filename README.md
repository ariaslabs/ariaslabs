## Hello! 👋

I'm Christopher Arias, a driven software developer who thrives on tackling complex problems and experimenting with new technologies. I work at Amazon where I honed my ability to quickly adapt to new tools and processes, resulting in efficient and effective problem-solving.

When not coding: 
- Fueling with espresso 💻☕️
- Taking things apart and putting them back together 🔧🔨

Let's connect and create something amazing together! ╰(*°▽°*)╯
